### 1. Introduction to Python
Python is a versatile and powerful programming language that's widely used in various fields, such as web development, data science, and artificial intelligence. It's known for its readability and ease of use, making it an excellent language for beginners.
### 2. Setting up your environment
To start, you'll need Python installed on your computer. You can download the latest version from the <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" target="_new">official Python website</a>.

Next, you'll need a code editor. We recommend <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_new">Visual Studio Code</a> for its user-friendly interface and extensive features.
### 3. Python basics: Loops and Conditionals<h4>Loops</h4>
Loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times. In Python, there are two types of loops: `for` loops and `while` loops.

<strong>For loop:</strong>

```
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

```

In this example, the `for` loop iterates over the numbers 0 to 4 and prints each number.

<strong>While loop:</strong>

```
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1

```

The `while` loop continues to execute the code block as long as the specified condition (count &lt; 5) is true.
<h4>Conditionals</h4>
Conditionals are used to execute code based on specific conditions. The basic structure of a conditional statement in Python is an `if` statement, followed by zero or more `elif` (short for "else if") statements, and an optional `else` statement.

```
x = 5

if x < 0:
    print("x is negative")
elif x == 0:
    print("x is zero")
else:
    print("x is positive")

```

In this example, the program checks whether the value of `x` is negative, zero, or positive and prints the appropriate message.
### 4. Introduction to DataFrames
DataFrames are two-dimensional tabular data structures provided by the popular Python library `pandas`. They're ideal for working with large datasets and come with a variety of built-in functions.

To install `pandas`, open a terminal or command prompt and run:

```
pip install pandas

```

Now, let's create a simple DataFrame with some sample data:

```
import pandas as pd

data = {'A': [1, 2, 3],
        'B': [4, 5, 6],
        'C': [7, 8, 9]}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)

```

The output should look like this:

```
   A  B  C
0  1  4  7
1  2  5  8
2  3  6  9

```
### 5. Building a simple stock tracker
For this project, we'll use the `yfinance` library to fetch stock data. Install it by running:

```
pip install yfinance

```

Now, follow these steps to build your stock tracker:

**Assistant:**

<strong>Step 1:</strong> Import the necessary libraries and create a function to fetch stock data.

```
import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd

def get_stock_data(ticker, start_date, end_date):
    stock_data = yf.download(ticker, start=start_date, end=end_date)
    return stock_data

```

This function takes three arguments: the stock ticker, the start date, and the end date. It fetches the stock data using the `yfinance` library and returns it as a DataFrame.

<strong>Step 2:</strong> Define the stock symbols and the date range for your stock tracker.

```
stock_symbols = ['AAPL', 'GOOGL', 'MSFT']
start_date = '2022-01-01'
end_date = '2022-04-01'

```

Here, we've chosen three stock symbols (Apple, Google, and Microsoft) and a date range to track.

<strong>Step 3:</strong> Fetch the stock data for each symbol and store it in a dictionary.

```
stocks_data = {}

for symbol in stock_symbols:
    stock_data = get_stock_data(symbol, start_date, end_date)
    stocks_data[symbol] = stock_data

```

This loop iterates over the stock symbols, fetches the stock data using the `get_stock_data` function, and stores it in the `stocks_data` dictionary.

<strong>Step 4:</strong> Display the stock data for each symbol.

```
for symbol, data in stocks_data.items():
    print(f"\n{symbol} stock data:")
    print(data.head())  # Display the first 5 rows of the data

```

This loop iterates over the `stocks_data` dictionary and prints the first 5 rows of stock data for each symbol.

Now, when you run the script, you should see the stock data for the specified date range.
### 6. Conclusion
Congratulations! You've learned the basics of Python programming, including loops, conditionals, and DataFrames, and you've built a simple stock tracker. This tutorial provides a foundation for further exploration in Python and its libraries. As you continue learning, consider expanding your stock tracker with features like data visualization, more advanced analytics, or even automating data updates.

To help students learn and troubleshoot, we can add questions and prompts throughout the tutorial that encourage them to think critically about the concepts and code they're working with. These prompts can also guide them towards solutions when they encounter issues.
### 3. Python basics: Loops and Conditionals
<strong>Prompt 1:</strong>
Try modifying the `for` loop example to print the numbers from 1 to 5 instead of 0 to 4. What do you need to change in the `range()` function?

<strong>Prompt 2:</strong>
In the `while` loop example, what would happen if you forget to increment the `count` variable inside the loop? How can you avoid this common mistake?

<strong>Prompt 3:</strong>
Experiment with different values for `x` in the conditional example. Can you create a more complex conditional statement that checks for additional conditions, such as whether `x` is even or odd?
### 4. Introduction to DataFrames
<strong>Prompt 4:</strong>
Add a new column to the sample DataFrame with your own data. What happens when the new column has a different number of elements than the other columns?

<strong>Prompt 5:</strong>
Try accessing a specific row or column in the DataFrame. What methods or attributes can you use to achieve this?
### 5. Building a simple stock tracker
<strong>Prompt 6:</strong>
Modify the `get_stock_data` function to fetch only specific data, such as the stock's adjusted closing price or trading volume. You can refer to the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/" target="_new">yfinance documentation</a> for more information.

<strong>Prompt 7:</strong>
If the stock data isn't displaying as expected, check the stock symbols and date range for any errors. Are the symbols valid? Is the date range formatted correctly and within the available data?

<strong>Prompt 8:</strong>
Extend the stock tracker to include more stocks or a longer date range. What potential issues might you encounter with a larger dataset, and how can you address them?

These prompts will help students engage with the material, better understand the concepts, and troubleshoot any issues they may encounter. Encouraging active learning and problem-solving will make the tutorial more effective and enjoyable for beginners.

# Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) Tutorial with Flowchart
In this tutorial, we'll introduce the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and show you how to implement it using Python. We'll also explain how to create a flowchart to visually represent the process.
## Table of Contents
1. Introduction to CAPM
2. Setting up your environment
3. Implementing CAPM with Python
4. Introduction to Flowcharts
5. Creating a flowchart for CAPM
6. Conclusion

### 1. Introduction to CAPM
The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is a widely-used finance theory that establishes a linear relationship between the expected return of an asset and its risk as measured by beta. Beta represents the asset's sensitivity to market movements. The model helps investors determine the appropriate required rate of return for an investment given its risk profile.

The CAPM formula is:

Expected Return = Risk-Free Rate + Beta * (Market Return - Risk-Free Rate)

Where:

- Expected Return: The return expected from the investment.
- Risk-Free Rate: The return on a risk-free asset, typically a government bond.
- Beta: The asset's risk relative to the market.
- Market Return: The overall return of the market.

### 2. Setting up your environment
Before we begin, make sure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download the latest version from the <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" target="_new">official Python website</a>.

We'll also use the `yfinance` library to fetch financial data, which you should have installed from the previous tutorial. If you haven't, you can install it with:

```
pip install yfinance

```
### 3. Implementing CAPM with Python
To implement CAPM in Python, follow these steps:

<strong>Step 1:</strong> Import the necessary libraries.

```
import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

```

<strong>Step 2:</strong> Define the stock symbol, market index, risk-free rate, and date range.

```
stock_symbol = 'AAPL'
market_index = '^GSPC'  # S&P 500
risk_free_rate = 0.02  # 2% annual return
start_date = '2022-01-01'
end_date = '2022-12-31'

```

<strong>Step 3:</strong> Create a function to calculate the stock's beta.

```
def calculate_beta(stock_data, market_data):
    cov_matrix = np.cov(stock_data, market_data)
    beta = cov_matrix[0, 1] / cov_matrix[1, 1]
    return beta

```

<strong>Step 4:</strong> Fetch the stock and market data, and calculate their daily returns.

```
stock_data = yf.download(stock_symbol, start=start_date, end=end_date)['Adj Close']
market_data = yf.download(market_index, start=start_date, end=end_date)['Adj Close']

stock_returns = stock_data.pct_change().dropna()
market_returns = market_data.pct_change().dropna()

```

<strong>Step 5:</strong> Calculate the stock's beta and expected return using CAPM.

```
beta = calculate_beta(stock_returns, market_returns)
expected_return = risk_free_rate + beta * (market_returns.mean() * 252 - risk_free_rate)

print(f"Beta: {beta:.2f}")
print(f"Expected Return: {expected_return * 100:.2f}%")

```

In this example, we've calculated the stock's beta and used it to estimate the expected return using CAPM.

a series of shapes and arrows to illustrate the steps and their order. Flowcharts are helpful for understanding complex processes, identifying potential issues, and communicating ideas effectively.

Common flowchart symbols include:

- Rectangle: Represents a process or action.
- Diamond: Represents a decision or conditional statement.
- Oval: Represents the start or end of a process.
- Arrow: Represents the flow of control between steps.

### 5. Creating a flowchart for CAPM
To create a flowchart for the CAPM implementation, follow these steps:

1. Start with an oval labeled "Begin".
2. Add a rectangle labeled "Import Libraries".
3. Add a rectangle labeled "Define stock symbol, market index, risk-free rate, and date range".
4. Add a rectangle labeled "Fetch stock and market data".
5. Add a rectangle labeled "Calculate daily returns".
6. Add a rectangle labeled "Calculate stock's beta".
7. Add a rectangle labeled "Calculate expected return using CAPM".
8. Add a rectangle labeled "Display beta and expected return".
9. Finish with an oval labeled "End".


Connect the symbols with arrows to represent the flow of the process. You can use a flowchart tool like <a href="https://app.diagrams.net/" target="_new">draw.io</a> or <a href="https://www.lucidchart.com/" target="_new">Lucidchart</a> to create your flowchart.
